# Simple Linear Regression

This repository contains code for the Simple Linear Regression project. We try out Linear Regression on:

- A Toy problem (numbers generated in a range)

  - [Scikit Learn](./scikit-learn-model/basics.ipynb)
  - [Pytorch](./pytorch-model/basics.ipynb)
  - [Tensorflow](./tensorflow-model/basics.ipynb)

- A Real-world problem (House Price Prediction) for [King County Housing dataset](./dataset/kc_house_data.csv)
  - [Scikit Learn](./scikit-learn-model/kc_house.ipynb)
  - [Pytorch](./pytorch-model/kc_house.ipynb)

---

## 3 approaches:

We try out Linear Regression model from **Scikit Learn** library, alongside a `Neural Network` (Single layer, with one neuron) model from **Pytorch** and **Tensorflow**.

> Although a Linear Regression model is better suited for regression problems, we still try to understand how a Neural Network model works for the same problem.
